h1. Pwss

A password manager in the spirit of "pws":https://github.com/janlelis/pws.

Features:

* Multiple entries can be stored in a single file
* Entries are "complex" records, including title, username, password, url, description
* Support for multiple password files
* The password file can be stored encrypted or not
* The password file is human-readable and editable (when not encrypted)
* Decrypt and encrypt commands allow one to operate directly on the password file

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pwss'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pwss

h2. Usage

*Getting started.* @pwss@ stores passwords in YAML files (also called "password safe" in the following), possibly encrypted.

A typical usage scenario is the following:

# @pwss init@ will create a new encrypted password safe in @~/.pwss.yaml.enc@
# @pwss add@ will add a new entry to the file
# @pwss get entry@ will retrieve all entries whose *title* contains @entry@

*Using multiple safes.* If you want to create your password safe in a different location, use the @-f@ (@--filename@) option:

# @pwss -f MYFILE init@
# @pwss -f MYFILE add@
# @pwss -f MYFILE get@

*Encrypted and Plain Files.* @pwss@ works equally well with encrypted and plain files.  More in detailes, the file extension determines whether @pwss@ tries to decrypt/encrypt the file or not.  Use @.enc@ to store password safes encrypted; any other extension will leave the file in plain format.

For instance:

<pre>
  $ pwss -f a.yaml.enc init 
</pre>

will store the password in to encrypted file @a.yaml.enc@.

By contrast,

<pre>
  $ pwss -f a.yaml get entry
</pre>

will try to retrieve @entry@ from file @a.yaml@, which is not encrypted.

Encrypting important passwords is a good idea.  However, if you use @pwss@ to store non-critical infomation, prefer to edit the password safe with a text editor, or use another application for managing encryption and decryption, using @pwss@ with the file in plain format might be more convenient.

*Moving from plain to encrypted.* Use the @encrypt@ and @decrypt@ commands at any time to move from the plain to the encrypted format.

<pre>
  $ pwss -f YOURFILE encrypt 
</pre>

will encrypt @YOURFILE@ while @decrypt@ will perform the opposite operation.

*Starting from an Existing File.*  You can also start from an existing file, as long as it is an array of YAML records, each containing, at least, a @title@ and a @password@ field.  (See next section, for the file structure.)

In this scenario, you can use the following commands to get started:

# @pwss -f YOURFILE encrypt@ will encrypt your existing password file
# @mv YOURFILE.enc ~/.pwss.yaml.enc@ moves the encrypted file to the default location (not necessary, but it simplifies the workflow)

To add entries to the password safe, use the @add@ command.  If you prefer to operate on the file using a text editor, you can also use the @decrypt@ and @encrypt@ commands.

*Getting Help.*

<pre>
  $ pwss
</pre>

will show all command options.

h2. Under the Hood

@pwss@ adopts a human-readable format for storing passwords, when the file is not encrypted, of course! (Unless you have mathematical super-powers and can read encrypted text.)

The password files is a YAML file containing an array of entries.  By default, entries have the following records:

* title
* username
* password
* url
* description

Example

<pre>
- title: A webservice
  username: username@example.com
  password: 1234567890
  url: http://www.example.com
  description: >
    with a password like the one above, who needs a password safe

- title: My email
  username: username@example.com
  password: 1234567890
  url: http://www.example.com
  description: >
    Also available via email client, with the following connection parameters
    smtp.example.com
    imap.example.com
</pre>

Notice that only @title@ and @password@ are required.
